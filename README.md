# GPT3 Wordpress Plugin

This is a Wordpress plugin that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate text. It allows users to enter a prompt, select a model and generate text based on the prompt and model selected.

We were thrilled with the power of ChatGPT – it allowed us to create this free WordPress plugin with just a few tweaks! 80% of the work was already done for us, so it was a breeze to get up and running!
