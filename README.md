# GPT4 Wordpress Plugin 

This is a Wordpress plugin that uses the [OpenAI](openai.com) GPT-4 API to generate text. It allows users to enter a prompt, select a model and generate text based on the prompt and model selected.

We were thrilled with the power of [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) â€“ it allowed us to create this free WordPress plugin with just a few tweaks! 80% of the work was already done for us, so it was a breeze to get up and running!

**Benefits of GPT-4:**
- Improved text generation quality
- Faster performance
- Better understanding of context
- Enhanced creativity and versatility
- GPT-4 can take inputs of up to 25,000 words at once, while GPT-3 can only handle 2,048 tokens2. This means that GPT-4 can handle longer and more complex texts2.
- GPT-4 can understand images as well as text, and generate captions or descriptions for them3. This makes it more multimodal and versatile than GPT-34.
- GPT-4 can perform more complex tasks with improved accuracy, scalability, and alignment4. This will allow for a wider range of applications such as language translation, text summarization, and conversational agents45.
