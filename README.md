# GPT4 Wordpress Plugin 

This is a Wordpress plugin that uses the [OpenAI](openai.com) GPT-4 API to generate text. It allows users to enter a prompt, select a model and generate text based on the prompt and model selected.

We were thrilled with the power of [ChatGPT](chat.openai.com) â€“ it allowed us to create this free WordPress plugin with just a few tweaks! 80% of the work was already done for us, so it was a breeze to get up and running!

## Demo Site
You can check out a demo of the plugin in action on the following site:
